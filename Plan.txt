Password Locker Project - Features and Implementation Guide

1. Project Overview
This project is a command-line based password locker developed in Python.
It allows users to securely save, retrieve, and manage passwords for different services.
The locker uses JSON files to store the data, and can be extended to include encryption and clipboard functionality.

2. Core Functionalities
- Add new password entry for a service
- Delete Existing entry
- Update existing password entry
- Search for a password entry
- Store data in JSON file (vault.json)
- Optional encryption of passwords
- Copy password to clipboard using pyperclip
- Data safely saved and loaded using 'with' statement

3. Data Storage - JSON File
Passwords and usernames are stored in a JSON file named vault.json.
Data is stored as a dictionary where keys are service names.
Example format:
{
  "gmail": {
    "username": "ammad123",
    "password": "encrypted_password"
  },
  "facebook": {
    "username": "leo_god",
    "password": "encrypted_password"
  }
}
Reading and writing JSON data is done with the json module using json.load() and json.dump().
The with statement is used for file handling to ensure the file is properly closed after operations.

4. Python 'with' Statement for File Handling
The 'with' statement automatically manages opening and closing files.
Using 'with open(filename, mode) as file:' ensures the file is closed safely even if errors occur.
It is cleaner and prevents bugs related to open files.

5. Using pyperclip for Clipboard Management
- pyperclip.copy(text) copies a string to the system clipboard.
- pyperclip.paste() gets the current text from the clipboard.
This can be used to copy passwords automatically for user convenience.

6. Encryption Methods Discussed
a. cryptography module (Fernet symmetric encryption):
   - Secure, industry-standard AES encryption.
   - Requires key management.
   - Example usage: encrypting and decrypting passwords safely.

b. Base64 encoding:
   - Simple encoding, NOT secure encryption.
   - Can encode and decode passwords but easily reversible.

c. XOR cipher:
   - Basic encryption using XOR operation with a key.
   - Easy to implement but not secure for real use.

7. Summary and Next Steps
- The project currently uses JSON for data storage.
- Use the 'with' statement to handle file reading/writing safely.
- You can enhance the locker by adding clipboard support with pyperclip.
- For security, integrate encryption with the cryptography module.
- Future improvements can include GUI, master password, and better UX.
